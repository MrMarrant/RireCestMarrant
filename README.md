### This is a Web Server Symfony, you can see it here :

## Install

I'm gonna explain how to install it on your local computer.
First of all, i need to explain you how my website was realised, it's a bit weird, the index is just a front page with a template (not mine, if i find him later, i will put the link here if i find it). This front page was used to "hide" my real website symfony, you can access to it with "localhost/etude" when everything will be installed.


You will need to install a DataBase, use whatever you want , mySQL, Mariadb, ect; i recommend you to use Wamp or Mamp for Mac.
You have the entire entity in the repo, i will explain later how to migrate them automatically.

When the DB is ready, link to the website, you will need to create a .env file at the root


More Comming soon!
